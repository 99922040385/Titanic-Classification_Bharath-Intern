Titanic Survival Prediction Model

This repository contains a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which is a classic dataset in machine learning. The dataset contains information about 891 passengers, including their age, sex, class, and whether they survived or not.

Features

The following features were used in the model:

Pclass: The class of the passenger (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
Age: The age of the passenger
Sex: The sex of the passenger (male or female)
SibSp: The number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: The number of parents/children aboard
Fare: The fare paid by the passenger
Target Variable

The target variable is Survived, which indicates whether the passenger survived or not (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive)

Model

The model used in this project is a Random Forest Classifier, which is a popular machine learning algorithm for classification problems. The model was trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the testing dataset.

Performance Metrics

The performance of the model was evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances
Precision: The proportion of true positives among all positive predictions
Recall: The proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall
Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 0.83, precision of 0.85, recall of 0.82, and F1 score of 0.83 on the testing dataset.

Code

The code for the model is contained in the titanic_survival_model.py file. The code includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation.

Requirements

Python 3.8 or higher
scikit-learn 0.24 or higher
pandas 1.3 or higher
numpy 1.20 or higher
matplotlib 3.4 or higher
seaborn 0.11 or higher
Usage

To use the model, simply run the titanic_survival_model.py file. The model will be trained and evaluated on the dataset, and the performance metrics will be printed to the console.
